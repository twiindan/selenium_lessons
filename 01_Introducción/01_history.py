# December 1989: Python implementation started by Guido van Rossum as a successor to
#                the ABC programming language capable of exception handling and
#                interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
#===============================================================================


#===============================================================================
# January 1994: Version 1.0 released, with functional programming tools like lambda,
#               map, filter and reduce
#===============================================================================


#===============================================================================
# 16 October 2000: Python 2.0 was released, with many major new features including a
#                  full garbage collector and support for unicode. Core development
#                  process shifted to a more transparent and community-backed process
#===============================================================================


#===============================================================================
# 3 December 2008: Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released
#                  after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have
#                  also been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.
#                  Backwards compatibility mainly broken because of print statement has
#                  been replaced with a print() function, massive usage of iterators
#                  instead of lists (as functions result)... and the most important one;
#                  all text (str) is Unicode and encoded text is binary data (bytes)
#===============================================================================


#===============================================================================
# 2010: Versions 2.6 and 2.7 with backports of several Py3k features to 2.X series:
#       collections, print, argparse, optimizations... as well as bugfixing. No more
#       new features will be added to 2.X series.

# November 2011: Python is the third most popular language on GitHub.com and it is
#                consistently in Top10 according to jobs postings and to the TIOBE
#                Programming Community Index.
